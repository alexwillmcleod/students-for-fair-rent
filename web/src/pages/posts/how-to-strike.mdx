Kia Ora! This is a how-to guide on striking for University of Auckland Accommodation students. On May 1st, Students for Fair Rent will start striking against Waipapa Taumata Rau and witholding rent.

Firstly, disable your automatic payment in your banking app from the 1st of May onwards. If someone else is paying, simply ask them to do so. If you don't have an automatic payment, just don't pay rent.

Let others know that you are striking. Pledge on <a href="/strike" class="text-blue-400 underline">our striking page</a> if you haven't already. Then reach out to your flat mates and neighbours. Chat with them about what a strike is, try to answer any questions they have using <a href="/info" class="text-blue-400 underline">our resources</a>, and encourage them to get involved.

Finally, join our Discord and get involved with other strikers
